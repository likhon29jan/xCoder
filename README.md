# xCoder an AI-powered web development agent that allows you to prompt, run, edit, and deploy full-stack applications directly from your browser—no local setup required. If you're here to build your own AI-powered web dev agent using the  open source codebase!

Full-Stack in the Browser:  integrates cutting-edge AI models with an in-browser development environment powered by StackBlitz’s WebContainers. This allows you to:

Install and run npm tools and libraries (like Vite, Next.js, and more)
Run Node.js servers
Interact with third-party APIs
Deploy to production from chat
Share your work via a URL
AI with Environment Control: Unlike traditional dev environments where the AI can only assist in code generation, itz gives AI models complete control over the entire environment including the filesystem, node server, package manager, terminal, and browser console. This empowers AI agents to handle the entire app lifecycle—from creation to deployment.
