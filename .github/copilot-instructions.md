## Code Style and Standards

â–² AI Elements
A command-line interface for installing AI Elements components - a component library built on top of shadcn/ui to help you build AI-native applications faster.

Overview
AI Elements provides pre-built, customizable React components specifically designed for AI applications, including conversations, messages, code blocks, reasoning displays, and more. The CLI makes it easy to add these components to your Next.js project.

Installation
You can use the AI Elements CLI directly with npx, or install it globally:

# Use directly (recommended)
npx ai-elements@latest

# Or using shadcn cli
npx shadcn@latest add https://registry.ai-sdk.dev/registry.json
Prerequisites
Before using AI Elements, ensure your project meets these requirements:

Node.js 18 or later
Next.js project with AI SDK installed
shadcn/ui initialized in your project (npx shadcn@latest init)
Tailwind CSS configured (AI Elements supports CSS Variables mode only)
Usage
Install All Components
Install all available AI Elements components at once:

npx ai-elements@latest
This command will:

Set up shadcn/ui if not already configured
Install all AI Elements components to your configured components directory
Add necessary dependencies to your project
Install Specific Components
Install individual components using the add command:

npx ai-elements@latest add <component-name>
Examples:

# Install the message component
npx ai-elements@latest add message

# Install the conversation component
npx ai-elements@latest add conversation

# Install the code-block component
npx ai-elements@latest add code-block
Alternative: Use with shadcn CLI
You can also install components using the standard shadcn/ui CLI:

# Install all components
npx shadcn@latest add https://registry.ai-sdk.dev/registry.json

# Install a specific component
npx shadcn@latest add https://registry.ai-sdk.dev/message.json
Available Components
AI Elements includes the following components:

Component	Description
actions	Interactive action buttons for AI responses
branch	Branch visualization for conversation flows
code-block	Syntax-highlighted code display with copy functionality
conversation	Container for chat conversations
image	AI-generated image display component
inline-citation	Inline source citations
loader	Loading states for AI operations
message	Individual chat messages with avatars
prompt-form	Controlled form wrapper for prompt submission
prompt-input	Advanced input component with model selection
prompt-input-attachments	Opt-in file/image attachments for prompt input
reasoning	Display AI reasoning and thought processes
response	Formatted AI response display
source	Source attribution component
suggestion	Quick action suggestions
task	Task completion tracking
tool	Tool usage visualization
web-preview	Embedded web page previews
Quick Start Example
After installing components, you can use them in your React application:

'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import {
  Conversation,
  ConversationContent,
} from '@/components/ai-elements/conversation';
import {
  Message,
  MessageContent,
} from '@/components/ai-elements/message';
import { Response } from '@/components/ai-elements/response';

export default function Chat() {
  const { messages } = useChat();

  return (
    <Conversation>
      <ConversationContent>
        {messages.map((message, index) => (
          <Message key={index} from={message.role}>
            <MessageContent>
              <Response>{message.content}</Response>
            </MessageContent>
          </Message>
        ))}
      </ConversationContent>
    </Conversation>
  );
}
How It Works
The AI Elements CLI:

Detects your package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn, or bun) automatically
Fetches component registry from https://registry.ai-sdk.dev/registry.json
Installs components using the shadcn/ui CLI under the hood
Adds dependencies and integrates with your existing shadcn/ui setup
Components are installed to your configured shadcn/ui components directory (typically @/components/ai-elements/) and become part of your codebase, allowing for full customization.

Configuration
AI Elements uses your existing shadcn/ui configuration. Components will be installed to the directory specified in your components.json file.

### General Principles
- Write clean, maintainable, and self-documenting code
- Follow functional programming principles where applicable
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use descriptive variable and function names that clearly indicate purpose

### TypeScript/JavaScript Standards
- Use TypeScript for all new code with strict mode enabled
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use async/await over promises chains for better readability
- Implement proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- Use ES6+ features: destructuring, spread operators, arrow functions
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions and public APIs
- Use meaningful type annotations - avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary

### React Best Practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused (under 200 lines)
- Extract custom hooks for reusable logic
- Use proper prop typing with TypeScript interfaces
- Implement proper error boundaries for error handling
- Optimize re-renders using React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback when necessary
- Follow the hooks rules strictly (only call at top level, only in React functions)

### File Structure
- Organize files by feature, not by type
- Keep related files close together
- Use index files for clean exports
- Name files using kebab-case for components: `my-component.tsx`
- Use descriptive folder names that indicate the feature or domain

## Architecture Patterns

### WebContainer Integration
- Always handle WebContainer operations asynchronously
- Implement proper error handling for filesystem operations
- Clean up resources when components unmount
- Use streaming for terminal output to provide real-time feedback
- Handle process lifecycle correctly (spawn, monitor, terminate)

### State Management
- Use React Context for global state when appropriate
- Consider Zustand or similar lightweight solutions for complex state
- Keep state as local as possible
- Lift state only when necessary for sharing between components
- Document state flow for complex features

### API Integration
- Create dedicated API service files for external integrations
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic
- Use environment variables for API keys and configuration
- Add request/response logging for debugging
- Implement rate limiting awareness

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests
- Write tests for all business logic and utilities
- Aim for high coverage on critical paths
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions and data flow
- Test WebContainer operations in isolated environments
